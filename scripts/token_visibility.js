/* Proposed algorithm:

The goal is to construct a polygon representing the visible area, absent walls, between
the source origin and the token shape. Then, for each intersecting wall, cut away part
of the polygon. If the origin is no longer part of the polygon, the token cannot be seen.

Step 1: Intersect Token shape with Token LOS to get constrained bounding box
If a token overlaps one or more walls, the potentially visible token area should not
include parts that are on the other side of the wall. Thus, intersect the token shape
against the token line of sight polygon. Call that the "constrained bounding box."

Step 2: Determine key constrained bounding box points.
Determine which points of the constrained bounding box represent the limits of what could
be seen from the vision source. If it were definitely a rectangle, that would be easy.
As a polygon, probably need to draw rays from each point to the origin. If the ray
intersects the polygon, it is not a key ray.

Step 3: Construct visibility polygon and rays
The polygon is the source origin --> key bounding box points.
Rays are origin --> key corner 1 and origin --> key corner 2 where 1 and 2 are found
by moving clockwise and counter-clockwise from origin around the visibility polygon.

Step 4: Get walls
Use quadtree to get walls that might intersect the polygon. Cull further by keeping only
walls that intersect one of the two rays or are contained entirely between the rays.
Return false early if a wall intersects both rays (such a wall completely cuts off the origin).
Return true early if zero or one wall found.
(A single wall intersecting only one ray cannot completely block the origin.)

Note that we need only know that a wall intersects the rays, not where the intersection is located.

Return true early if all the walls intersect the same ray.

(It might be possible to keep only interior walls or the wall that extends furthest into
the visibility polygon on each side. But "furthest" here is with respect to the origin
and is not easily determined without looking at intersection points and possibly shooting
rays from the origin to test for collisions.)

Step 5: Cut away the visibility polygon
At this point, we have 2+ walls that intersect both rays. With certain orientations,
such walls could combine to completely block vision.
(Think of a winding corridor, where a close wall from the right combines with a wall
further back from the left to block everything in sight.)

For each wall, construct a polygon from source origin --> wall.A --> wall.B ("wall polygon").

Use clipper difference to cut away the visibility polygon using the wall polygon.
If the origin is no longer part of the polygon, then we know the origin cannot see the token.
(This can be tested after each clipper operation; return false early if so).

If the origin is still present after all walls are added, return true.
